* What is process? 

A process is the execution of a program that allows you to perform the appropriate actions specified in a program. 
It can be defined as an execution unit where a program runs. The OS helps you to create, schedule, and terminates the processes 
which is used by CPU. The other processes created by the main process are called child process.
A process operations can be easily controlled with the help of PCB(Process Control Block). 

You can consider it as the brain of the process, which contains all the crucial information related to processing 
like process id, priority, state, and contents CPU register, etc.

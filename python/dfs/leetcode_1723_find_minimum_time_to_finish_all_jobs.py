1723. Find Minimum Time to Finish All Jobs

note: Binary Search + DFS + DP

You are given an integer array jobs, where jobs[i] is the amount of time it
takes to complete the ith job.
There are k workers that you can assign jobs to. Each job should be assigned
to exactly one worker. The working time of a worker is the sum of the time it
takes to complete all jobs assigned to them. Your goal is to devise an optimal
assignment such that the maximum working time of any worker is minimized.

Return the minimum possible maximum working time of any assignment.

Example 1:
Input: jobs = [3,2,3], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: By assigning each person one job, the maximum time is 3.

Example 2:
Input: jobs = [1,2,4,7,8], k = 2
Output: 11
Explanation: Assign the jobs the following way:
Worker 1: 1, 2, 8 (working time = 1 + 2 + 8 = 11)
Worker 2: 4, 7 (working time = 4 + 7 = 11)
The maximum working time is 11.

Constraints:
1 <= k <= jobs.length <= 12
1 <= jobs[i] <= 107

233. N Queens

Get all valid ways of putting N Queens on an N * N chessboard so that no two
Queens threaten each other.

Assumptions

N > 0
Return

A list of ways of putting the N Queens
Each way is represented by a list of the Queen's y index for x indices of 0 to
(N - 1)
Example

N = 4, there are two ways of putting 4 queens:

[1, 3, 0, 2] --> the Queen on the first row is at y index 1, the Queen on the
second row is at y index 3, the Queen on the third row is at y index 0 and the
Queen on the fourth row is at y index 2.
[2, 0, 3, 1] --> the Queen on the first row is at y index 2, the Queen on the
second row is at y index 0, the Queen on the third row is at y index 3 and the
Queen on the fourth row is at y index 1.

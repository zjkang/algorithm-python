1192. Critical Connections in a Network

There are n servers numbered from 0 to n-1 connected by undirected
server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [a, b]
represents a connection between servers a and b. Any server can reach any other
server directly or indirectly through the network.

A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some server
unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

Example 1:
Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
Output: [[1,3]]
Explanation: [[3,1]] is also accepted.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5
n-1 <= connections.length <= 10^5
connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]
There are no repeated connections.

536. Construct Binary Tree from String

You need to construct a binary tree from a string consisting of parenthesis and integers.

The whole input represents a binary tree. It contains an integer followed by zero, one or two pairs of parenthesis. The integer represents the root's value and a pair of parenthesis contains a child binary tree with the same structure.

You always start to construct the left child node of the parent first if it exists.

 

Example 1:
Input: s = "4(2(3)(1))(6(5))"
Output: [4,2,6,3,1,5]

Example 2:
Input: s = "4(2(3)(1))(6(5)(7))"
Output: [4,2,6,3,1,5,7]

Example 3:
Input: s = "-4(2(3)(1))(6(5)(7))"
Output: [-4,2,6,3,1,5,7]
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104
s consists of digits, '(', ')', and '-' only.

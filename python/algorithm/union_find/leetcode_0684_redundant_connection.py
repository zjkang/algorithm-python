684. Redundant Connection

In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and
has no cycles.
The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes
(with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added.
The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not
an edge that already existed.
The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges
is a pair [u, v] with u < v, that represents an undirected edge connecting
nodes u and v.
Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of
N nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in
the given 2D-array. The answer edge [u, v] should be in the same format,
with u < v.

Example 1:
Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
  1
 / \
2 - 3
Example 2:
Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]
Output: [1,4]
Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
5 - 1 - 2
    |   |
    4 - 3
Note:
The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.
Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N,
where N is the size of the input array.

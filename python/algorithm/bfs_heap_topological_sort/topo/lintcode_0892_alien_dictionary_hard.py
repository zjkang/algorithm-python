892. Alien Dictionary

There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet.
However, the order among letters are unknown to you. You receive a list of
non-empty words from the dictionary, where words are sorted lexicographically
by the rules of this new language. Derive the order of letters in this language.

样例
Example 1:
Input：["wrt","wrf","er","ett","rftt"]
Output："wertf"
Explanation：
from "wrt"and"wrf" ,we can get 't'<'f'
from "wrt"and"er" ,we can get 'w'<'e'
from "er"and"ett" ,we can get 'r'<'t'
from "ett"and"rftt" ,we can get 'e'<'r'
So return "wertf"

Example 2:
Input：["z","x"]
Output："zx"
Explanation：
from "z" and "x"，we can get 'z' < 'x'
So return "zx"

注意事项
You may assume all letters are in lowercase.
The dictionary is invalid, if a is prefix of b and b is appear before a.
If the order is invalid, return an empty string.
There may be multiple valid order of letters, return the smallest in normal lexicographical order

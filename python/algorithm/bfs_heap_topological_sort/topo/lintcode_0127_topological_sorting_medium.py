127. Topological Sorting

Given an directed graph, a topological order of the graph nodes is defined as
follow:

For each directed edge A -> B in graph, A must before B in the order list.
The first node in the order can be any node in the graph with no nodes direct to it.
Find any topological order for the given graph.

样例
挑战
Can you do it in both BFS and DFS?

说明
Learn more about representation of graphs

注意事项
You can assume that there is at least one topological order in the graph.

630. Knight Shortest Path II

Given a knight in a chessboard n * m (a binary matrix with 0 as empty and 1 as
barrier). the knight initialze position is (0, 0) and he wants to reach
position (n - 1, m - 1), Knight can only be from left to right.
Find the shortest path to the destination position, return the length of
the route. Return -1 if knight can not reached.

样例

Example 1:
Input:
[[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0]]
Output:
3
Explanation:
[0,0]->[2,1]->[0,2]->[2,3]

Example 2:
Input:
[[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[0,0,0]]
Output:
-1
说明
If the knight is at (x, y), he can get to the following positions in one step:

(x + 1, y + 2)
(x - 1, y + 2)
(x + 2, y + 1)
(x - 2, y + 1)

137. clone graph

Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list
of its neighbors. Nodes are labeled uniquely.

You need to return a deep copied graph, which has the same structure as the
original graph, and any changes to the new graph will not have any effect on
the original graph.

样例
Example1
Input:
{1,2,4#2,1,4#4,1,2}
Output:
{1,2,4#2,1,4#4,1,2}

说明

注意事项
You need return the node with the same label as the input node.

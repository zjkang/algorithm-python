178. Graph Valid Tree

Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges
(each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to check whether these edges
make up a valid tree.

样例
Example 1:
Input: n = 5 edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]]
Output: true.

Example 2:
Input: n = 5 edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4]]
Output: false.
注意事项
You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.

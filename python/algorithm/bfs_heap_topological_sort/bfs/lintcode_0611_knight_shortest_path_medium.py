611. Knight Shortest Path

Given a knight in a chessboard (a binary matrix with 0 as empty and 1 as
barrier) with a source position, find the shortest path to a destination
position, return the length of the route.
Return -1 if destination cannot be reached.

样例
Example 1:
Input:
[[0,0,0],
 [0,0,0],
 [0,0,0]]
source = [2, 0] destination = [2, 2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
[2,0]->[0,1]->[2,2]

Example 2:
Input:
[[0,1,0],
 [0,0,1],
 [0,0,0]]
source = [2, 0] destination = [2, 2]
Output:-1
说明
If the knight is at (x, y), he can get to the following positions in one step:

(x + 1, y + 2)
(x + 1, y - 2)
(x - 1, y + 2)
(x - 1, y - 2)
(x + 2, y + 1)
(x + 2, y - 1)
(x - 2, y + 1)
(x - 2, y - 1)
注意事项
source and destination must be empty.
Knight can not enter the barrier.
Path length refers to the number of steps the knight takes.

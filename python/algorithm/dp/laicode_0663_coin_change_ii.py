663. Coin Change II

You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money
amount. Write a function to the number of different combinations that
can sum up to that amount.

Example 1:
coins = [1,2] , amount = 5
return 3

Explanation:

5 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2

Note:
You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.
